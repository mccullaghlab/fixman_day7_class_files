 &cntrl
  imin=0, ! Not a minimization run
  ntx=1, ! Only coordinates from restart file
  ntxo=2, ! The final coords, velocities, box size in NetCDF
  ioutfm=1, ! Print mdcrd to NetCDF format
  irest=0, ! Not a velocity restart 
  ntwr=100000, ! Very high value for how often restart file is written
  nstlim=50000, ! Number of MD steps, for a 2 fs ts this is 100 ps
  dt=0.002, ! Time step in picoseconds, so this is 2 fs
  ntf=2, ! Do not calc the force for SHAKE constrained bonds
  ntc=2, ! Use SHAKE for all hydrogen bonds
  ntpr=500, ! How often to print
  ntwx=1000, ! How often write coordinates, every 2 ps
  cut=8.0, ! nonbonded cutoff
  ntb=1, ! Periodic boundaries for constant volume
  ntp=0, ! No pressure control for this phase
  ntt=3, ! Use the Langevin thermostat
  gamma_ln=1.0, ! Frequency of collisions for thermostat
  nmropt=1, ! NMR restraints and weight changes
  ig=-1, ! Randomize seed for Langevin thermostat
  ntr=1, ! turn on restraints
  restraint_wt=10.0, ! force constant for restraints
  restraintmask=':1-20,@CA,C,O,N', ! restrained atoms
